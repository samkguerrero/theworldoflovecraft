This is my first website. I wanted to learn web mapping, and ended up learning how to build a simple website with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. For my first attempt at programming, i'm impressed with how it turned out.

Mission:
<p class="text"> After completing <a href="http://arcg.is/1NP1MPs">The World of Lovecraft Tour</a> web map with <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/features/apps/index.html">ArcGIS Online</a>, I wanted to try to recreate it with open-source libraries. I felt my map was limited to the templates that ArcGIS Online provide. I recreated The World of Lovecraft Tour using the open-source JavaScript libary <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>. Here I was able to incorporate simple elements into my map that I felt were not accessible with ArcGIS Online templates. With Leaflet, I could manipulate the code and design the map with greater detail.</p>

Simply download and unzip the folder. Open the love.html file with Firefox. Scroll through the column on the left to see how it turned out!
